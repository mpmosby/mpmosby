## 🏠 Home Lab Experience
Over the past month, I’ve built and managed a home lab designed to simulate enterprise security environments. Highlights include:  

- Built an **Active Directory enterprise network** from scratch (multi-VM, segmented networks using pfSense).  
- **Configured Snort IDS/IPS** for detection and prevention testing.  
- Deployed **Splunk** and centralized logs from Sysmon and Snort for analysis.  
- Conducted **vulnerability assessments** using Nessus and validated findings with Nmap & Wireshark.  
- Practiced **forensics & malware analysis** using tools like Autopsy, OSForensics, FTK Imager.  
- Ran simulated attacks using **Kali Linux & Metasploitable**, documented detections and responses.  
- Used snapshots and rollback strategies to replicate red team vs blue team scenarios.  

> *Not all of these labs have dedicated project repos, but the hands-on experience has built strong investigative and defensive skills.*
