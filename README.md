## üõ†Ô∏è Core Skills
- **Security Engineering:** Firewalls (pfSense), IDS/IPS (Snort), SIEM (Splunk), Endpoint Hardening  
- **Blue Team & Detection:** Sysmon, log analysis, detection rule tuning, incident response  
- **Networking:** Network segmentation, VLANs, DHCP, NAT, VPN configuration  
- **Cloud Security:** AWS (S3, IAM, CloudTrail), Azure Fundamentals

## üè† Home Lab Experience
Over the past month, I‚Äôve built and managed a home lab designed to simulate enterprise security environments. Highlights include:  

- Built an **Active Directory enterprise network** from scratch (multi-VM, segmented networks using pfSense).  
- **Configured Snort IDS/IPS** for detection and prevention testing.  
- Deployed **Splunk** and centralized logs from Sysmon and Snort for analysis.  
- Conducted **vulnerability assessments** using Nessus and validated findings with Nmap & Wireshark.  
- Practiced **forensics & malware analysis** using tools like Autopsy, OSForensics, FTK Imager.  
- Ran simulated attacks using **Kali Linux & Metasploitable**, documented detections and responses.  
- Used snapshots and rollback strategies to replicate red team vs blue team scenarios.  

> *Not all of these labs have dedicated project repos, but the hands-on experience has built strong investigative and defensive skills.*

## üìÇ Featured Projects
Here are some of the larger projects I‚Äôve built (or am building) from my home lab:  

- **[Enterprise Security Lab ‚Äì Part 1 (Setup)](https://github.com/mpmosby/Enterprise-Security-Lab-Part-1)**  
  Multi-VM enterprise lab build (pfSense, AD, Splunk, Sysmon, Kali, Metasploitable).  

- **[Enterprise Security Lab ‚Äì Part 1.5 (Snort)](https://github.com/mpmosby/Enterprise-Security-Lab---Part-1.5)**  
  IDS/IPS deployment and rule tuning using Snort, with detection validation and lessons learned.  

- **Enterprise Security Lab ‚Äì Part 2 (Mr. Robot Exercise)** *(Planned)*  
  Simulated red and blue team exercise detecting and responding to attacks using Kali Linux, Snort, and Splunk.  

- **Vulnerability Management Project (Nessus + Validation)** *(Planned)*  
  Full vulnerability management workflow using Nessus for scanning, Nmap/Wireshark for validation, and mock remediation reporting.  

- **Web Application Pen Testing / Forensics Project** *(Planned)*  
  Hands-on web application testing using OWASP Juice Shop & Burp Suite (covering OWASP Top 10) with forensics follow-up (Autopsy, OSForensics).
